The Karuna Assignment Quiz System is a dynamic Windows Forms application written in C#. The project is designed to create and manage quizzes for educational purposes, making it a useful tool for teachers, tutors, or students who need to create quizzes for assignments or practice.

The system allows educators to create custom quizzes with different question types, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short answers. The quiz system provides a structured way for users to manage questions, define correct answers, and review quiz results. The primary objective is to simplify the process of creating and administering quizzes, especially for teachers who want to test students on various subjects.

Some of the standout features include:

Question Management: Add, edit, or delete quiz questions and organize them by category or difficulty level.
Quiz Generation: Teachers can create quizzes with a mix of question types, setting timers for each quiz to simulate exam conditions.
Automated Grading: After a quiz is completed, the system grades the answers automatically and provides instant feedback to the student, helping them learn more effectively.
Quiz Reports: Generate reports on student performance, allowing teachers to assess knowledge gaps and adjust their lesson plans accordingly.
The system is built with scalability in mind, meaning that it can be expanded to support additional features like importing and exporting quizzes, integrating with external educational platforms, or enabling online quiz taking. Overall, this project serves as a versatile educational tool for both classroom and personal use.
